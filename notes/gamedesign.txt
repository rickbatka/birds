resource: pp

start with 5 pp
start with 4 cards
cards have a cost (usually 1 or 2 pp)
one shot per turn
	card can give you more shots - for a cost
regen 1 pp per turn
	card can be used: 3 additional pp over next 3 turns (something like that) ('urn of flowing power')
players are positioned on islands floating in the sky
players are hard to move (really heavy) and have health
players die when health is empty or they fall off their island
games are async and should therefore be < 10 total turns (tweak this obv)
players can shoot through their own defenses - important! maybe show your base as partially transparent while shooting
player health starts at 100, most basic vanilla attack does 10 damage.
	cards to regain 15-25 health
	cards can give more powerful shots to do more damage
	damage-over-time effects that do around 5% for x number of turns
can have lots of games going at once
